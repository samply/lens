# samply.lens

**samply.lens** is a front-end web component library that provides essential functionalities for building search, exploration, and visualization web applications. It offers a set of flexible building blocks while remaining open to user-specific extensions.

This library can be included in various ways. Below are some examples of tools built with samply.lens:

- [CCP-Explorer](https://github.com/samply/ccp-explorer)
- [BBMRI-Sample-Locator](https://github.com/samply/bbmri-sample-locator)

- [Type Documentation (TSdocs)](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/modules.html)

## 🏗 Architecture

The main goal of **samply.lens** is to standardize common aspects of building search and exploration applications. It is structured around four core pillars:

1. **Catalogue** – Supplies search attributes in a standardized format.
2. **Query Language** – Defines a query structure (internally called `queryitems`, externally known as AST) that can be generated by samply.lens components or external tools.
3. **Execution** – AST queries can be processed by Samply components or custom implementations.
4. **Standardized Result Definitions** – Ensures compatibility with visualization tools such as charts and exploration interfaces.

We strive to keep the library lightweight. Therefore, **samply.lens** does not include any major CSS libraries. However, all components are fully customizable. We use **Web Components**, ensuring compatibility with major JavaScript frameworks:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
