# Lens

Lens is a front-end library, that provides common functionalities necessary for building search, exploration and visualization applications. The primary target of this library is to deliver a good amount of building blocks, while also being open to user specific extensions.

## Documentation

The [Lens Book](https://samply.github.io/lens/book/) is the work-in-progress documentation for Lens. [API docs](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/) are available as well.

## Development

To get started developing on Lens install npm and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:samply/lens.git
cd lens
npm install
npm run dev
```

To test your local changes in an application such as the [CCP Explorer](https://github.com/samply/ccp-explorer) use [lens-test](https://github.com/samply/lens-test).
