# Version 0.6.0

## Migration guide

### QueryExplainButton

In earlier versions of Lens, we used a specialized version of the `<lens-info-button>` to display the current query or a portion of it. This functionality has now been refactored into a dedicated component: `<lens-query-explain-button>`.

Replace:

```svelte
<lens-info-button noQueryMessage="Empty Query" showQuery={true}
></lens-info-button>
```

With:

```svelte
<lens-query-explain-button noQueryMessage="Empty Query"
></lens-query-explain-button>
```

### Querying the backend

In the new version, Lens will no longer query backends itself when the search button is clicked. Instead, the application must read the current query from the search bar, send the query to a backend to get results, and then pass the results to Lens so it can show them.

To give a short summary of the new paradigm, the application listens to the global `lens-search-triggered` event, then retrieves the current query using the new [`getAst`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/getAst.html) function, optionally uses the new [`createBeamTask`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/createBeamTask.html) function to send the query to a backend, and then passes the results to Lens via the new [`markSiteClaimed`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/markSiteClaimed.html) and [`setSiteResult`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/setSiteResult.html) functions. More details and example codes can be found in the dedicated guides.

TODO: create and link dedicated guides

The `setSiteResult` function accepts the new [`SiteResult`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/types/SiteResult.html) format that is independent of the FHIR standard. [Focus](https://github.com/samply/focus) can return the new result format from version X.X.X (TODO: specify version) onwards. If you have a FHIR result you can convert to the new format using the [`measureReportToSiteResult`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/measureReportToSiteResult.html) function.

A number of related APIs have been removed in favor of the new paradigm:

- The `backend` field has been removed from the Lens options
- The `emit-lens-query` event has been renamed to `lens-search-triggered` and does no longer contain the `details` field
- The `getResponseAPI()` function has been removed from the `LensDataPasser` (TODO: we are planning to remove LensDataPasser completely so remove this line)
- The `lens-responses-updated` event has been removed

### Catalogue prop changes

If you are using the collapsible catalogue feature, the texts for the expand/collapse button are now no longer specified as props:

```diff
 <lens-catalogue
-    texts={{
-        collapseButtonTitle: 'My custom expand text',
-        expandButtonTitle: 'My custom collapse text',
-    }}
     toggle={{ collapsable: true }}
 ></lens-catalogue>
```

If you specified any other texts in the `texts` prop you can remove them as well as they are no longer used. The expand/collapse button texts are now specified in the Lens options [as translations](../guide/translations.md):

```json
"texts": {
    "catalogue_expand": {
        "en": "My custom expand text"
    },
    "catalogue_collapse": {
        "en": "My custom collapse text"
    },
}
```

### CSS class name prefixes updated

Starting with version **0.6**, all Lens CSS class names now begin with the prefix `lens-` followed by the component name.
This change improves readability, provides clearer structure, and helps avoid unintentional conflicts with existing styles or overrides.

**If you are overriding any Lens component styles**, please review your class names to ensure they match the new naming convention.

### Query in URL

The URL now always updates to stay in sync with the current query so can share and bookmark queries via the URL. You can disable this in the Lens options:

```json
"autoUpdateQueryInUrl": false
```

### Removed iconOptions

Because this feature was rarely used icons in Lens can no longer be customized. Remove these lines from your Lens options:

```json
"iconOptions": {
  "deleteUrl": "delete_icon.svg",
  "infoUrl": "info-circle-svgrepo-com.svg",
  "toggleIconUrl": "right-arrow-svgrepo-com.svg",
  "addIconUrl": "long-right-arrow-svgrepo-com.svg"
},
```

You can also remove the icon image files if your app does not use them anywhere else.

### Removed LensDataPasser

The `<lens-data-passer>` component which was previously used to access a number of APIs has been removed. Most of these APIs have now been exported as regular TypeScript functions and some have been deprecated:

| Old API                                              | Replacement                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `getResponseAPI`                                     | Apps are now responsible for querying the backend so they have access to the responses without need for an API.                                                                                                         |
| `getAstAPI`                                          | [`getAst`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/getAst.html)                                                                                                                                                    |
| `updateResponseStoreAPI`                             | [`setSiteResult`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/setSiteResult.html), [`markSiteClaimed`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/markSiteClaimed.html)                                              |
| `getCriteriaAPI`                                     | This API was previously used to resolve subgroups in the AST (e.g. replace `C50.%` with `C50.1`, `C50.2`, etc.). From Lens version 0.6.0 onwards the AST returned by `getAst()` already has subgroups resolved for you. |
| `getCatalogueAPI`                                    | Apps control the catalogue so there should be no need to read it from Lens.                                                                                                                                             |
| `setQueryStoreAPI`                                   | [`setQueryStore`](https://samply.github.io/lens/docs/functions/setQueryStore.html)                                                                                                                                      |
| `setQueryStoreFromAstAPI`, `addStratifierToQueryAPI` | Only select applications use these APIs and we have provided a replacement for them but use of this function in new code is discouraged.                                                                                |
| `removeItemFromQueryAPI`, `removeValueFromQueryAPI`  | If possible, use `getQueryStore` and `setQueryStore` instead.                                                                                                                                                           |
