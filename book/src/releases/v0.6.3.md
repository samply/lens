# Version 0.6.3

## Features

- Charts now support sorting by value or alphabetically with visual toggle buttons that indicate sort direction. Enable this feature by setting the `enableSorting` prop to `true`. Defaults to alphabetical ascending sort.

## Breaking changes

- Removed unused `system` key from catalogue, query store, and AST
- Renamed `hideFailedSite` to `removeFailedSite`

## Migration guide

### Removal of `system` key

Remove the `system` key from your catalogues. It was unused before so nothing will break when you remove it.

### Rename of `hideFailedSite`

Update your application to use `removeFailedSite` instead of `hideFailedSite`.
