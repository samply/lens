# Version 0.6.3

## Features

- Charts now support sorting by value or alphabetically with visual toggle buttons that indicate sort direction. Enable this feature by setting the `enableSorting` prop to `true`. Defaults to alphabetical ascending sort.

## Breaking changes

- Removed unused `system` key from catalogue, query store, and AST
- Renamed `hideFailedSite` to `removeFailedSite`
- Changed `buttonSize` prop on Lens-Info-Button to numeric value
- Changed `alignDialogue` prop on Lens-Info-Button from `"left" | "right" | "center"` to `"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"`

## Migration guide

### Removal of `system` key

Remove the `system` key from your catalogues. It was unused before so nothing will break when you remove it.

### Rename of `hideFailedSite`

Update your application to use `removeFailedSite` instead of `hideFailedSite`.

### Changeing of `buttonSize`

Update your info buttons to take numeric values instead of a string containing `px` on `buttonSize` prop.

### Changeing of `alignDialogue`

Update your info buttons to take one of `"top-left" | "top-center" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-center" | "bottom-right"` on `alignDialogue` prop.
