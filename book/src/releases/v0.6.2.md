# Version 0.6.2

## Improvements

- Enhanced Toast System: Introduced a unified toast component (`LensToast`) that supports multiple toast types including error and info notifications with consistent styling and behavior
- Query Explain Button Redesign: The redesigned query explain button now presents search details in user-friendly language with improved formatting and search bar chips displays query information in depth.

## Breaking Changes

- Component Rename: `error-toast` component has been replaced with the more versatile `lens-toast` component
- Function API Change: `showErrorToast()` function has been replaced with `showToast(message, type)` where `type` accepts `error` or `info`
- Removed the `showInSearchbar` prop as the component now automatically determines display behavior based on input context.

## Migration Guide

### Toasts

Update your HTML tags:

```html
<!-- Before --->
<error-toast></error-toast>

<!-- After --->
<lens-toast></lens-toast>
```

Update your toast function calls:

```typescript
// Before
import { showErrorToast } from "./toast";
showErrorToast("Something went wrong!");

// After
import { showToast } from "./toast";
showToast("Something went wrong!", "error");
showToast("Operation completed successfully!", "info");
```

### Query Modified Component

The `<lens-search-modified-display>` component no longer has a `<slot>`. Remove any text inside the component tag and optionally customize the text using [translations](../guide/translations.md):

```json
"texts": {
    "query_modified": {
        "en": "My custom text"
    }
}
```

### Result Table Pagination Changes

The page size switcher was removed so you should remove the `pageSizeSwitcher` prop if you were using it. The result table now operates in two modes:

```
<!-- Table in unpaged mode shows all rows and grows dynamically with the number of rows -->
<lens-result-table></lens-result-table>
<!-- Table in paged mode limits the number of rows per page and has fixed height -->
<lens-result-table pageSize={10}></lens-result-table>
```
