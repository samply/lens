# About Lens

The `lens-about` component is optional but recommended for your application. It displays:

- A link to the Lens repository
- A short message: “Made with ♥”
- Additionally, it includes an info (“i”) icon. Clicking this icon opens a popover that shows the current version of the Lens library.
