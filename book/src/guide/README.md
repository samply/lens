# User Guide

This guide will help you set up your exploration tool using Lens.

We recommend starting with a new application using the [new-app](new-app.md) guide, followed by connecting your data source as described in the [query](query.md) documentation and passing results to Lens as shown in the [showing results guide](results.md). Documentation for all [available components](../components/README.md)

To customize the appearance of lens components, refer to the [overwriting styles guide](overwriting-styles.md) for instructions on how to apply your own styles.
